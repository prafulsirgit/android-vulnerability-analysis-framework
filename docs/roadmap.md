# Project Roadmap
<!-- This document outlines the development plan and future goals for the **Android Vulnerability Analysis Framework**. The roadmap is intended to provide a high-level overview of the project's direction and serve as a guide for contributors. -->

## Current Status

- **Initial Setup Completed**: GitHub repository and basic project structure established.
- **Core Tools Selected**: Integration with Codacy, PMD, and Android Lint for static analysis.
- **Documentation**: Basic documentation including README, CONTRIBUTING guide, and Code of Conduct.

## Short-Term Goals (Next 3 Months)

1. **Framework Development**
   - Implement core functionality for static code analysis using Codacy and other tools.
   - Develop modules for manifest and build configuration analysis.
   - Implement dependency analysis for third-party libraries.

2. **Documentation Enhancement**
   - Expand documentation to include detailed setup instructions and usage examples.
   - Create tutorials and guides for contributing to the project.

3. **Community Engagement**
   - Promote the project on social platforms and developer communities.
   - Gather initial feedback and address issues raised by early adopters.

4. **Automated Reporting**
   - Develop a reporting module to generate comprehensive vulnerability reports.
   - Integrate with GitHub Actions for continuous integration and reporting.

## Mid-Term Goals (3-6 Months)

1. **Tool Integration**
   - Explore and integrate additional static analysis tools, such as MobSF and FindBugs.
   - Implement automated code quality checks and enforce coding standards.

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Implement a dashboard for visualizing analysis results.
   - Develop a plugin system to allow community-developed extensions.

3. **Community Contributions**
   - Foster a contributor community by organizing events like hackathons and meetups.
   - Set up a dedicated forum or chat for discussion and support.

4. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Enhance CI/CD pipeline to automatically run analysis on pull requests.
   - Implement quality gates and alerts based on analysis results.

## Long-Term Goals (6-12 Months)

1. **Machine Learning Integration**
   - Explore machine learning models for identifying complex patterns and vulnerabilities.
   - Implement anomaly detection for more sophisticated security checks.

2. **Real-Time Analysis**
   - Develop capabilities for real-time code analysis during development.
   - Integrate with popular IDEs like Android Studio for in-editor feedback.

3. **Expanding Support**
   - Extend support to other platforms such as iOS or web applications.
   - Develop multilingual support for a wider reach and usability.

4. **Community Growth**
   - Establish a sustainable community with dedicated maintainers and regular contributors.
   - Create a comprehensive knowledge base and documentation hub.
