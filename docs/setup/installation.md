# Installation Guide

This document provides step-by-step instructions to install and set up the **Android Vulnerability Analysis Framework** on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the installation, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher**:
   - Required for running Android-related tools.
   - [Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

2. **Android Studio**:
   - Required for building and analyzing Android projects.
   - [Download Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

3. **Python 3.8 or higher**:
   - Needed for running certain analysis scripts and dependencies.
   - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

4. **Git**:
   - Required for version control and cloning the repository.
   - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

5. **Codacy CLI**:
   - Required for integrating with Codacy for code quality checks.
   - [Codacy CLI Documentation](https://docs.codacy.com/).

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prafulsirgit/android-vulnerability-analysis-framework.git
cd android-vulnerability-analysis-framework
```

## Step 2: Install Required Dependencies

### Python Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip. It's recommended to create a virtual environment first.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Android SDK and NDK

Ensure that the Android SDK and NDK are installed via Android Studio. Add the following paths to your system's environment variables:

- **ANDROID_HOME**: Path to the Android SDK (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk`).
- **NDK_HOME**: Path to the Android NDK (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\ndk-bundle`).

## Step 3: Configure Codacy

Follow these steps to integrate Codacy:

1. Sign up or log in to Codacy.
2. Create a project and link it to your GitHub repository.
3. Download the Codacy CLI and add it to your system's PATH.
4. Run the following command to authenticate Codacy:

    ```bash
    codacy auth
    ```

5. Use the following command to analyze your code:

    ```bash
    codacy analyze
    ```

## Step 4: Initial Analysis

Run the initial analysis on your Android project:

1. Navigate to the root directory of your Android project.
2. Run the analysis using Codacy CLI or the included scripts in this repository:

    ```bash
    python analyze.py
    ```

This will analyze the codebase and generate a report in the `reports/` directory.

## Step 5: Verify Installation

Verify that all components are installed correctly by running the following command:

```bash
python verify_installation.py
```

If the verification is successful, you're all set!

## Troubleshooting

- **Java Errors**: Ensure that the correct version of JDK is installed and set in your environment variables.
- **Codacy Issues**: Verify that the Codacy CLI is authenticated and the project is correctly linked.
