## 1. Getting Started

If you're new to the project, start by reading the [Introduction](../introduction.md) to understand the goals and features of the framework. Once you're familiar with the project, follow the steps below to set up your development environment.

## 2. Setting Up the Development Environment

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 11 or above
- **Android Studio**: Latest version (for Android development)
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or above (for scripting and automation tasks)
- **Git**: Version control system
- **Node.js** (Optional): For JavaScript-related tasks, if applicable
- **Codacy Account**: Set up Codacy to analyze code quality (optional)

### Cloning the Repository

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prafulsirgit/android-vulnerability-analysis-framework.git
   cd android-vulnerability-analysis-framework
   ```

3. Add the original repository as an upstream remote:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/prafulsirgit/android-vulnerability-analysis-framework.git
   ```

### Installing Dependencies

1. **Java Dependencies:**
   - Run the following command to install all required Java dependencies (using Maven or Gradle as specified):

   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

2. **Python Dependencies:**
   - Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

   - Install Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Codacy Setup (Optional):**
   - Follow the [Codacy Documentation](https://docs.codacy.com/) to connect your repository and configure code quality checks.

### Setting Up Codacy

1. Log in to [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/) with your GitHub account.
2. Select your repository to start analyzing.
3. Configure Codacy to run automated code reviews on pull requests.

## 3. Project Structure

The following is an overview of the project structure:

└── .gitignore                # Git ignore file
```

## 4. Coding Standards

- **Code Style**: Follow the standard conventions for Java (Google Java Style) and Python (PEP 8).
- **Comments**: Write clear and concise comments for complex code. Use Javadoc for Java code and docstrings for Python.
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Variables and Methods: `camelCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

## 5. Writing Tests

1. **Test Framework**: Use JUnit for Java tests and pytest for Python scripts.
2. **Test Location**: Place all test files in the `src/test` directory.
3. **Test Naming**: Name test methods descriptively, e.g., `testCalculateVulnerabilityScore`.
4. **Run Tests**: Use the following command to run all tests:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew test
   ```

## 6. Submitting Changes

1. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```

2. **Commit Your Changes**: Follow the commit message conventions:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature to analyze third-party dependencies"
   ```

3. **Push the Branch**: Push your branch to your forked repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-feature
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request**: Go to the GitHub page and create a pull request from your branch.

5. **Address Feedback**: Be open to feedback and make necessary changes.

## 7. Project Workflow

1. **Issue Creation**: Create issues for features or bug fixes.
2. **Discussion**: Discuss the issue and assign it to yourself if you plan to work on it.
3. **Development**: Implement the solution in a feature branch.
4. **Testing**: Write tests for your changes.
5. **Pull Request**: Submit a pull request for review.
6. **Review and Merge**: Project maintainers will review and merge your changes.

## 8. Useful Commands

- **Build the Project**: `./gradlew build`
- **Run Tests**: `./gradlew test`
- **Check Code Style**: `./gradlew checkstyleMain`
- **Generate Javadocs**: `./gradlew javadoc`
