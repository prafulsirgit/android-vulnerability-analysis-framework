[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/677879469f5c4d0cb96464d0dff9a435)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/prafulsirgit/android-vulnerability-analysis-framework/dashboard?utm_source=gh&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=&utm_campaign=Badge_grade)

## Overview

The **Android Vulnerability Analysis Framework** is an open-source project designed to provide a comprehensive framework for conducting static analysis of Android applications. The primary goal is to detect and mitigate security vulnerabilities early in the development process, ensuring robust and secure Android apps.

## Features

- **Automated Code Analysis**: Integrates with tools like Codacy, Android Lint, PMD, and SpotBugs for in-depth code analysis.
- **Configuration Analysis**: Checks `AndroidManifest.xml` and `build.gradle` files for insecure configurations.
- **Dependency Analysis**: Identifies vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and provides recommendations for updates.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates comprehensive reports highlighting vulnerabilities, severity, and remediation suggestions.
- **Open Source**: Contribute to the project, suggest features, or fix issues.
